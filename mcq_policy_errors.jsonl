In this scenario, the agreement between the employer and the employee is an entire contract (Option A) because if the employee is fired after six months, the employee might argue that the employer breached the agreement's implied promise of one year of employment.\n\nThe other contract types can be explained as follows:\n\n1. Divisible contract: An agreement divided into separate parts or stages, where the failure to perform one part does not affect the other parts (not applicable in this scenario).\n2.
